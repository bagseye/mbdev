I've put together a quick guide for creating a random quote generator using Javascript that you can integrate on your next project. I find writing about these things makes it easier for me to fully understand the processes required.

## First Up

I find it is best to write down the steps required, this will make it easier later on down the line as you try to build up your functions.

## A Place to Store the Quotes

You’ll need a place to store the quotes, and as with many languages there are a number of ways this could be done. For this example I am going to use a basic array.

```javascript
var quotes = [
  "The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing",
  "If life were predictable it would cease to be life, and be without flavor",
  "Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans",
  "When you reach the end of your rope, tie a knot in it and hang on",
  "Never let the fear of striking out keep you from playing the game",
  "Life is either a daring adventure or nothing at all",
  "Love the life you live. Live the life you love",
  "If you really look closely, most overnight successes took a long time",
  "I failed my way to success",
  "Success is walking from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm",
]
```

## Setup the Markup

This will be really simple as all you’re going to need is a container to store the updated content in. Styling, and class names are completely up to you but to get you going add this to your HTML file

```html
<div class="quotes">
  <article class="container">
    <h1 id="quoteArea"></h1>
  </article>
</div>
```

## Start building up the function

Now that has been setup you need to create a querySelector that will reference the container that will hold each random quote. Add the following line to your JS file:

```javascript
var quoteArea = document.querySelector("#quoteArea")
```

As you might already guess, this will find the tag with the ID quoteArea and store it in a variable of a similar name. Now you could get bogged down in modern Javascript here and use the new variable keywords, but for the moment that’s not a concern.

For the moment I’ll set things up in a function called changeQuotes which will do the bulk of the switching. In here it will do a few things - count the length of the quotes array, request a random number, and display a random quote. First up, you’ll need to find out the length of the array so within the changeQuotes function write the following:

```javascript
function changeQuotes() {
  var quotesLength = quotes.length
}
```

Next, you'll want to generate a random number. To do this we'll create another, separate function that will pick a random number between 0 and the length of the array. Add the following lines to your JS file:

```javascript
function getRandomInt(max) {
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * Math.floor(max))
}

function changeQuotes() {
  var quotesLength = quotes.length
  var randomNum = getRandomInt(quotesLength)
}
```

Now, with the length of the array and the newly acquired random number, use that to create a variable called randomQuote and display the quote on the frontend

```javascript
function changeQuotes() {
  var quotesLength = quotes.length
  var randomNum = getRandomInt(quotesLength)
  var randomQuote = quotesLength[randomNum]

  quoteArea.innerHTML = randomQuote
}
```
